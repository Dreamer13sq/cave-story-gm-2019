King Date,
	Fuyuhiko is king of Litagano.
	
Mimigar,
	A once booming city full of busy Mimiga. Now a town filled with
	crime, pollution, and fear.
	
Curly,
	She was a hero who was going to put a stop to Date's plans, but was defeated.
	Now her body is used to create less intelligent clones of herself for various 
	purposes. Some replaced the jobs that some people already held, some are sold as workers. 
	Once word got around that Curly had lost, most of the inhabitants 
	of Litagano began losing hope. In midst of creating the Curly Clones, Date's
	most skilled workers began working on a new super soldier, a Curly 2.0. Once
	the new model is done, the orignial Curly was to be thrown into the junk heap,
	never to be found again.
