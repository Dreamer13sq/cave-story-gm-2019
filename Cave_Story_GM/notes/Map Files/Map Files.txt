/// 

==Pxe Files==
- Houses Data for Entities
	- First four bytes represent the file type ("PXE.")
	- Next 2 Bytes are the number of entities
	- Data of first entity starts at 0x8
	- From the starting point of an entity...
		- Bytes 0x0 - 0x1 is the X cell position of the Entity
		- Bytes 0x2 - 0x3 is the Y cell position of the Entity
		- Bytes 0x4 - 0x5 is the Entity ID
		- Bytes 0x6 - 0x7 is the Event Number
		- Bytes 0x8 - 0x9 is the Entity Type
		- Bytes 0xA - 0xB is the Entity Flags
		
		- Each part of data is 2 bytes, 
		  meaning they can hold integer values up to 0xFF (65535)
		- Entity data is 12 bytes long
------------------------------------- 

==Pxm Files==
- Houses Data for Stage Tiles
	- First four bytes represent the file type ("PXM.")
	- Next Four bytes are dimensions
		- Bytes 0x4 - 0x5 are the Stage width
		- Bytes 0x6 - 0x7 are the Stage height
	- Tile Data starts at 0x8
		- Each byte represents a tile
			- Meaning tile images cannot exceed 256 tiles
		- Data goes to end of file
		
------------------------------------- 

==Tsc Files==
THE FOLLOWING IS WRONG!!
- Houses Data for scripts
	- It's a text file, only every character is bumped up by 0x4C (76) bytes
		- Subtract 0x4C (76) from every byte in the file and you get something readable.
		
-------------------------------------

==Pxa Files==
- Data for Tile Collision Mapping
	- Bytes match the position of the tile in the tile image file.
		- i.e. Byte 7 will be the collision for Tile 7
	- Data goes to end of file
		- File size is always 0xFF (256) bytes
		
-------------------------------------

==Map Properties==
- Map Properites exist in Doukutsu.exe starting at byte 0x937B0
	- From the starting point of a stage...
		- Bytes 0x00 - 0x1F is the name of the tileset image (without "Prt")
		- Bytes 0x20 - 0x3F is the name of the map
		- Bytes 0x40 - 0x43 is the type of scrolling for the background
		- Bytes 0x44 - 0x63 is the name of backround image
		- Bytes 0x64 - 0x83 is the name of the first NPC image file
		- Bytes 0x84 - 0xA3 is the name of the second NPC image file
		- Byte	0xA4 is the Boss Fight ID
		- Bytes 0xA5 - 0xC4 is the map caption
		- Bytes 0xC5 - 0xC7 are unknown/unused
	- Stage Properties is 0xC8 (200) bytes long
