Notes:
 Invalid commands show an error message displaying the command before the game exits
 The "jump if equipped" function is done with FLJ - an arbitrary flag is chosen, and every instance of EQ+/EQ- must also have the FL+/FL- command
 The colon between parameters can be any character (it's ignored)
