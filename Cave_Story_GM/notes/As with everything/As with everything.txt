I like to start things that are overly ambitious
and because I have so much fun with it
and, at least at the moment, I have so much free time,
I've no reason to stop.

This is too large though
and I would like to work on other things.
More specifically Dream Story and if I get some miracle stream of imagination, Dream Squad.

It's not that I don't want to work on this, quite the opposite.
It's just that this is purely a passion project
and my biggest one yet.
It would take too much time
so I'd like to force moderation on working on it.

^ I wrote this in 2018. 
It's the end of 2022, and this sentiment stayed true for all of my projects.
The worst thing about Game dev is that it's too fun.

"More specifically Dream Story". Hah!
