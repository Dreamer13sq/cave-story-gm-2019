Hold "1" while restarting to load the animmaker
Use Ctrl + O to open the animation.anim file
I used this to write a database to load animations from during the game
Do Ctrl + Shift + E to Copy the database code to clipboard and paste into the loadAnimationGroup() script
Be sure to use Ctrl + S to save changes

While this version of animmaker works, it is not the most updated version.
It functions ands does what I need, but is prone to crashing (so save frequently!)
The version in my other main project is more cleaner in terms of code and has more features.

You could always fix it up yourself, though...
